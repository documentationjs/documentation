# the default theme

![](screenshot.png)

This is the default theme for [documentationjs](https://github.com/documentationjs):
it consists of underscore templates and a few assets: a [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
theme and [basscss](https://basscss.com/) as a basic CSS framework.

This is bundled by default in documentation: it is the default theme.

The contents are the following:

* `index._`, the main template that defines the document structure
* `section._`, a partial used to render each chunk of documentation
* `assets/*`, any assets, including CSS & JS
